- Download data for train the models in ```Train_model.ipynb``` [click link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HFYCd6BLShfe3hPn5yM0EbGl3NvOMIcp?usp=drive_link) that contain ```Image_train.csv``` and ```Attribute_train.csv```

```Train_model.ipynb``` is the notebook that use to generate the models. There are 5 models. 
  1. Linear regression (OLS : ordinary least square)
  2. Polynomial regresion
  3. RandomForest
  4. XGboost
  5. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- The output file of ```Train_model.ipynb``` are ```compare_model_result.csv``` and ```trained_model```
